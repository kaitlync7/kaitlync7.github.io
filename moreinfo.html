<!-- Impacted Communities -->
<h2 class = "SecT"> <u> Communities Impacted </u></h2>
<p class = "SecP"> Food insecurity impacts communities anywhere in the world but is prominent in low income/poverished areas, children, seniors, and POC (people of color). </p>
</section>

<!-- Causes -->
<section>
<h2 class = "SecT"> <u> Causes </u></h2>
<p class = "SecP"> Some causes of food insecurity include low income, lack of resources, life challenges, health, and the pandemic.  Many people have to choose between food and other options such as housing or medical care and have to sacrifice one thing for the other. </p>

<!-- Misconceptions -->
<section>
<h2 class = "SecT"> <u> Misconceptions </u></h2>
<p class = "SecP"> A common misconception is that food insecurity only happens to people living in poverty. This is untrue as food insecurity does not discriminate. Some people who are below the poverty line do not experience food insecurity and some people above do. Another common misconception is that government programs provide enough food to satisfy peoples hunger needs. This is incorrect since an individual has to meet qualifications to recieve this assistance and the program is not meant to provide a supplemental amount of food.</p>
